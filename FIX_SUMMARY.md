# Fix Summary: Mason-LSPConfig API Compatibility Issue

## Problem
The tests were failing with the error:
```
module 'mason-lspconfig.mappings.server' not found
```

This was occurring in LazyVim's LSP configuration at line 215 of `lua/lazyvim/plugins/lsp/init.lua`, where it was trying to access:
```lua
require("mason-lspconfig.mappings.server").lspconfig_to_package
```

## Root Cause
The `mason-lspconfig.nvim` plugin API had changed. The old API used `mason-lspconfig.mappings.server.lspconfig_to_package`, but the current version uses `mason-lspconfig.mappings.get_mason_map().lspconfig_to_package`.

## Solution
I fixed this by patching the LazyVim plugin in `plugins.nix`:

1. **Created an inline patch** instead of using a separate patch file for better reliability
2. **Used `substituteInPlace`** to replace the old API call with the new one:
   ```nix
   substituteInPlace $out/lua/lazyvim/plugins/lsp/init.lua \
     --replace 'require("mason-lspconfig.mappings.server").lspconfig_to_package' \
               'require("mason-lspconfig.mappings").get_mason_map().lspconfig_to_package'
   ```
3. **Updated the spec** to point to the patched version using `makeLazySpec`

## Files Modified
- `plugins.nix`: Added inline patch for LazyVim plugin to fix mason-lspconfig API usage

## Verification
- All `test-edit` tests now pass (confirmed by building specific test derivations)
- Health checks show mason-lspconfig is working correctly
- LazyVim can now load without the API error

## Technical Details
The fix ensures that when LazyVim tries to get the list of available LSP servers from mason-lspconfig, it uses the correct API method that exists in the current version of the plugin. This allows the LSP configuration to load properly and the tests to pass.
